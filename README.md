### **Manual Testing Project**
The Startech Test Case Project is designed to ensure the functionality, reliability, and performance of the Startech system through a well-structured testing process. This document serves as a guide to understanding the project's purpose, structure, and artifacts.

### **Project Overview**
This project focuses on verifying and validating the different modules and features of the Startech system by executing comprehensive test cases. The primary goal is to identify defects, ensure compliance with requirements, and improve the overall quality of the software.


### **Project Structure**
The project follows a structured approach to testing and includes various artifacts, which are categorized as follows:
-**Mind Map**: A visual representation of the testing scope and strategy.

-**Test Scenarios**: High-level test conditions that define what needs to be tested.

-**Test Cases**: Detailed test cases outlining specific test steps, inputs, expected outcomes, and actual results.

-**Test Summary Report**: A document summarizing the testing activities, coverage, and (pass/fail statistics) outcomes.

-**Bug Report**: Documentation of identified defects, including their severity, status, and resolution.

-**Test Metrics**: Quantitative data representing test execution progress, defect density, pass/fail rates, and other relevant insights.



### **Technology Used**
-**Excel**: For managing test cases, scenarios, and reports.
